Shiny App:
CancerDrugResponseApp isn't finished yet, but will need two files that are too large to be on here in it's data folder:
CCLE_RNAseq_genes_counts_20180929.gct
GDSC2_fitted_dose_response_15Oct19.csv
These can be obtained from the [CCLE](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle) and [GDSC](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/) websites, respectively.
