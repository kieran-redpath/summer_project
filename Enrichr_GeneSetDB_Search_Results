*Enrichr and GeneSetDB results for significant genes (for dasatinib AUC and IC50) from breast, colorectal, and stomach cancer.*

Enrichr Pathways:
Integrin beta-4. (BioPlanet 2019)
Laminin interactions H. sapiens (Reactome 2016)
ECM-receptor interactions. (KEGG 2019 Human)
Inflammatory Response Pathway WP453. (Wikipathways 2019 Human)

Enrichr Ontologies:
ECM organisation. (GO Biological Process 2018)
Calcium channel regulator activity. (GO Molecular Function 2018)
Focal adhesion. (GO Cellular Component 2018)

Enrichr Misc:
Laminin pops up a few times.

GeneSetDB:
Alpha6 beta4 integrin-ligand interactions. (Pathway Interaction Database)

Notes:
Integrin beta-4 "is likely to play a pivotal role in the biology of invasive carcinoma" according to Entrez Gene.
Laminin may be involved in EMT in cancer.
Laminins are involved in ECM organisation, as well as the WP53 inflammatory response pathway.
